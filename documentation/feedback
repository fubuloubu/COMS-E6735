Proposal 1

This is a challenging topic.  I would suggest you start more easily,
possibly first starting with the ichigenkin, and possibly working up
to the erhu, and going no farther than a bass guitar or double bass,
where size relative to the hands plays to your advantage.  Further,
start by focusing on the hand that stops (frets) the strings; that is
more obvious and temporally extended than a pluck.  The references
strongly suggest that this is a very difficult problem.  Freeze the
number of performers to more than three, instruments to no more than
2, and do not vary the environment.  Performance evaluation requires
manual annotation, so have everyone play exactly the same piece.  Some
of them should play it in time to a metronome that helps with the
alignment of the result to the annotation.

Prototype 1

Not much evidence of testing.  Overly ambitious evaluation plan.

Final 1

Small number of videos.  No real output (tablature, etc.).   Hand placement very errorful.

Binary Descriptor matching
 - easier for users
 - rotation invariant
 - susceptible to noise?
 - very slow

work on this
one-shot learning
go over this in a meeting

Guitar model
 - trouble finding full length of strings and all of frets
 - estimation framework attempted
 - use guitar location point model for hand location
