In conclusion, the work done on the project so far shows promising results were obtained,
but much further work is necessary to improve the accuracy of each required layer such that
an precise final output can be obtained that is useful for human guitar players.
In particular, the location framework can be greatly improved in order to assist in
limiting the search area for the rest of the layers, which would be a huge boon for overall
performance. The hand and guitar modeling could also be improved with both algorithmic and
robustness enhancements (time-variant filtering and spatial-variant filtering) that could
greatly improve performance to be on a level required for a final product.
