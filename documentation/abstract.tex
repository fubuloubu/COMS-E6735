% Preface statement in main document
will describe the outline of a system that can analyze videos
of amateur and professional recordings of common stringed musical instruments and
produce human readable tabulature for that performance.
The system will use several computer vision techniques to analyze the video,
showing which string position and string was being fretted the moment a note was stricken.
A method for identifying hand positions in particular will be adapted from the literature
to fit with the hand model for string instruments to aid in identifying finger locations
when the hand partially obscures the fingers.
\par
The system will be vetted against a compilation of several different types of video
obtained from a variety of instruments, performers, and playing styles.
The performance of the system will be evaluated based on correctness of results produced,
as well as the overall speed of the application, although speed of the application does not need to be real-time to be effective.
