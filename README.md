# Guitar Note Identification Project

Algorithm:

   * Locate guitar in frame
   * Identify location and number of strings
   * Identify location and number of frets
   * Model and store intersection of frets and strings
   * Identify hand locations
   * Model finger locations
   * Model intersection of string/fret model and finger location model
   * Identify string pluck motion events
   * Store musical state from model intersection during motion events
